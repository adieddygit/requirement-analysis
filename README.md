## What is Requirement Analysis?

### Requirement Analysis in Software Development

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the project team collaborates with stakeholders to gather, analyze, and define the requirements of the software system to be developed.  
This process ensures that everyone involved has a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should accomplish and how it should perform.

During this phase, the team identifies the **functional and non-functional requirements** of the system‚Äîwhat the software should do, the conditions it must operate under, and the constraints it must adhere to.  
The outcome of this stage is typically a **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** document, which serves as a blueprint for design, development, and testing.  
It's important for building software that meets user expectations, stays within scope, and delivers value to the business. It lays the groundwork for all subsequent stages of the SDLC.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements ‚öôÔ∏è

**Definition:**  
Functional requirements describe what the hotel booking system should do ‚Äî the essential features and operations that enable users (customers and hotel managers) to perform their tasks efficiently.

**Examples:** Property search, user registration, hotel listing management, booking and payment processing, user authentication.

**Key Functional Requirements:**

- **Search Properties:**  
  Users should be able to search for hotels or rooms based on criteria such as location, price range, amenities, and availability.  
  _Example:_ A traveler searches for ‚Äú2-star hotels in Accra with free Wi-Fi and breakfast.‚Äù

- **User Registration:**  
  New users (both customers and hotel managers) should be able to create accounts with personal and login details to access the system.

- **Property Listings:**  
  Hotel managers should be able to add, update, and manage hotel information including room types, prices, images, and descriptions.  
  _Example:_ A hotel manager uploads new room images and updates room rates during the festive season.

- **Booking System:**  
  Customers should be able to book available properties, view booking details, and manage or cancel their reservations.  
  _Example:_ A customer books a double room for three nights and receives instant confirmation.

- **User Authentication:**  
  The system should have a secure login and registration process to verify user identity and protect account access.

---

### Non-functional Requirements üõ°Ô∏è

**Definition:**  
Non-functional requirements describe how the hotel booking system should perform, focusing on quality aspects like performance, scalability, and security rather than on specific functionalities.

**Examples:** Performance, security, scalability, usability, reliability.

**Key Non-functional Requirements:**

- **Performance:**  
  The system should load pages within 2 seconds and efficiently handle up to 10,000 concurrent users, especially during peak booking seasons.

- **Security:**  
  User data, including payment details, must be encrypted. Implement secure authentication and protect the system from threats like SQL injection, XSS, and data breaches.

- **Scalability:**  
  The system should be built on a microservices architecture to scale horizontally as traffic and data volume increase (e.g., adding more servers for high demand).

- **Usability:**  
  The application should have an intuitive and user-friendly interface, ensuring smooth navigation for both customers and hotel managers.  
  _Example:_ A simple booking flow that allows first-time users to complete a reservation in under three steps.

- **Reliability:**  
  The platform should maintain 99.9% uptime and include redundancy and recovery mechanisms to minimize downtime and data loss.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Acceptance Criteria** are clearly defined conditions that determine whether a software feature or functionality has been successfully implemented.  
They outline the **expected behavior** of a feature and serve as a **benchmark for completion and approval** by stakeholders.

In essence, acceptance criteria translate **business requirements** into **measurable outcomes**, ensuring that the developed feature truly meets user needs and aligns with project objectives.

They act as a **shared understanding** between developers, testers, and stakeholders‚Äîguiding implementation, driving test cases, and confirming that the final product performs as intended before release.

### Importance of Acceptance Criteria in Requirement Analysis

Acceptance Criteria play a crucial role in **Requirement Analysis** by defining the exact conditions under which a requirement or feature is considered complete and satisfactory. They serve as a bridge between stakeholders and developers, ensuring mutual understanding of expectations and quality standards before implementation begins.

#### Key Importance:

1. **Clarity and Shared Understanding**  
   Acceptance Criteria provide a clear, measurable definition of what success looks like for each requirement.  
   This eliminates ambiguity and ensures that stakeholders, developers, and testers all interpret the requirement in the same way.

2. **Guidance for Development and Testing**  
   They act as a reference point during design, coding, and testing phases, helping developers build exactly what was requested  
   and enabling testers to verify whether the system meets the specified conditions.

3. **Improved Quality and Validation**  
   By clearly stating what ‚Äúdone‚Äù means, Acceptance Criteria ensure that all delivered features meet quality expectations  
   and functional goals before they are approved.

4. **Facilitates Communication and Collaboration**  
   They promote collaboration between business analysts, developers, and stakeholders, encouraging discussion about user needs,  
   priorities, and success measures early in the process.

5. **Supports Traceability and Compliance**  
   Acceptance Criteria make it easier to trace each requirement from conception to testing and validation,  
   ensuring full coverage and accountability throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

6. **Prevents Scope Creep and Rework**  
   Clearly defined criteria help prevent uncontrolled changes by setting measurable limits for what is included in a requirement,  
   saving time and reducing rework.
